# Quake 2 Freeze Tag - AI-Assisted Development Experiment

This repository documents an experiment in AI-assisted game development, where **AmpCode** - Sourcegraph's AI coding agent - was used to modernize and enhance a classic Quake 2 Freeze Tag mod.

## Project Overview

- **q2_orig/**: Original Quake 2 source code (76 files)
- **freeze_orig/**: Legacy Freeze Tag implementation (78+ files)  
- **freeze_new/**: Modern AI-enhanced version with new features

## What is Freeze Tag?

A 4-team multiplayer game mode where players freeze instead of dying. Teammates must thaw frozen players while avoiding being frozen themselves. The last team standing wins!

*(Note: The core freeze tag gameplay exists in `freeze_orig/` from the original implementation)*

## AI-Enhanced Features (So Far)

Working with **AmpCode**, we've begun adding modern enhancements to `freeze_new/`:

### üéØ Start Weapon System ‚úÖ
- Configurable starting weapons for newly spawned players
- Bitwise flag system (`start_weapon` cvar: 1=shotgun, 2=super shotgun, 4=machinegun, etc.)
- Automatic ammo allocation
- Default loadout: shotgun + super shotgun + rocket launcher

### ü™ù Grappling Hook System ‚úÖ
- Physics-based hook projectile with collision detection
- Dynamic pull force based on chain length
- Variable chain length control (grow/shrink modes)
- Visual chain rendering
- Configurable parameters via CVars

### üë• 4-Team Auto-Assignment System ‚úÖ
- Automatic team balancing (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
- Players auto-assigned to team with fewest members on join
- Complete team damage prevention
- CTF skins for visual team identification
- Enhanced chat system with team indicators
- Team-only communication support
- Manual team switching via `team` command
- Public announcements for team joins/switches

### üéÆ Still To Be Implemented
- Port core freeze tag mechanics from `freeze_orig/`
- Freeze/thaw player mechanics
- Ready system and map voting

## The AI Development Process

This project showcases what's possible when human creativity meets AI capability:

- **Planning**: AmpCode analyzed the original code and proposed comprehensive implementation plans
- **Feature Development**: From basic mechanics to complex grappling hook physics
- **Code Quality**: Maintained original Q2 architecture while adding modern features  
- **Documentation**: Generated extensive inline documentation and configuration guides

## AmpCode Stats

- **3 new systems** implemented so far (start weapons, grappling hook & 4-team system)
- **6+ core files** modified with AI assistance (freeze.h, freeze.c, g_local.h, p_client.c, g_combat.c, g_cmds.c)
- **~800+ lines** of new code generated for weapons, hooks and team systems
- **Full backward compatibility** maintained with original Q2 architecture

## Build Instructions

1. Open `freeze_new/src/game.sln` in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution
3. Launch with `freeze.bat` or `freeze - dedicated server.bat`
4. Configure via CVars and map-specific settings

## Technical Notes

- Built for Windows with Visual Studio integration
- Complete multiplayer conversion (not just a mod)
- Extensive CVAR configuration system
- Compatible with original Q2 map formats
